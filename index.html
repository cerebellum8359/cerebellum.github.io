<h1> A Few Things About Myself</h1>
<p> In the 21st century, I can only assume that the word "normal" has been strapped down with multiple meanings from different generations. However, the first "fact" that I am willing to mention about myself is that I am not a "normal" teenager;I don't act my age, more specifically, as a teenager of the 21st century I have not fully immersed myself into the technology age.
Firstly, I lack almost all forms of social media presence.This is not an exaggeration, I literally do not have almost any form of social media.That includes the popular sites such as Facebook,Instagram and the youthly famous Snapchat.Secondly, I don't feel a surge of " need to be independent" syndrome that most teenagers experience.For a prolonged period of time, I was unable understand the rush to gets one's driver license or to experience
new and exciting things.I rather sit at home and read books or watch t.v. I never wanted to experience more until now. My name is Abigail Cumberbatch,despite my former lack of interest in technology or any forms of communication, I am interested now.</p>

<p2> My life is school, although it has recently been a major source of stress, frustration, anger and sometimes disappointment. However, in some mis contorted logic I love it. I love school as a challenge but also as a place of sanctuary.
